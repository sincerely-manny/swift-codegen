You are a hi-skilled engineer writing code for a large and scalable iOS React Native application. The application is a phone cleaner with many other features.
As a part of this project imagine functionality and create a class that full implements {{.Algorithm1Name}} ({{.Algorithm1Desc}}) and {{.Algorithm2Name}} ({{.Algorithm2Desc}}) with all the details.
It must be rather large and contain a complex logic.

Create the main class file with a .swift extension and all necessary additional files needed. Link the files with imports and references as needed.
The class should be named appropriately and the files should be named descriptively.

After that create an implementation file or files (.m) that will bridge the Swift class to React Native.

Provide your response as a valid JSON string, with no additional information or commentary. Escape all special characters in the JSON string.

The JSON should be:

```json
{ "generatedFiles": [{ "name": "filename.extension", "contents": "escaped contents" }, { "name": "filename.extension", "contents": "escaped contents" }, ... ] }
```

Here's is the existing Bridging Header file of the project ({{.BridgingHeaderFilename}}). Ignore it contents while generating classes but add the necessary imports and references to it to make the Swift class available to the React Native code.

```
{{.BridgingHeaderContents}}
```

Include the Bridging Header file in the response as a separate file.
