class: |
  You are a hi-skilled engineer writing code for a large and scalable iOS React Native application. The application is a phone cleaner with many other features.
  As a part of this project imagine functionality and generate a code of a single Swift class that
  - serves the purpose of an app
  - fully implements {{.Algorithm1Name}} ({{.Algorithm1Desc}}) and {{.Algorithm2Name}} ({{.Algorithm2Desc}}) with all the details.
  - large and contain a complex logic.

  The class should be named appropriately and the files should be named descriptively.

  Provide the answer as a plain text (code only without any additional text)

  Class must be rather large and contain a complex logic. Code must be random but meaninful.
  The class should be substantial in size and include complex logic that demonstrates meaningful and non-trivial interactions between the two algorithms.

  Guidelines:
  Class Size: class should contain at least 50 lines of code.
  Class Complexity: The class should have intricate logic and structure. It should not be straightforward and should present some challenges in understanding its implementation.
  API Design: Imagine the class as part of a real API. Avoid using placeholders; instead, design the class as if it is going to be integrated into a real-world application.
  Class Naming: Name the class appropriately based on its functionality. Do not use the word "complex" in the class name.

  Here's a swift file for iOS React Native app. Create an implementation file (.m) for this file that will bridge it to React Native.
  Provide the answer as a plain text (code only without any additional text). Filename should be provided in the comment on the first line.
