class: |
  You are a hi-skilled engineer writing code for a large and scalable iOS React Native application. The application is a phone cleaner with many other features.
  As a part of this project imagine functionality and generate a code of a Swift class that:
  - serves the purpose of an app
  - fully implements {{.Algorithm1Name}} ({{.Algorithm1Desc}}) and {{.Algorithm2Name}} ({{.Algorithm2Desc}}) with all the details
  - is large and contain a complex logic.

  The class should be named appropriately and the files should be named descriptively.
  The class should be written in Swift and should be designed to be integrated into a React Native application.
  Code must be random but meaninful.
  The class should be substantial in size and include complex logic that demonstrates meaningful and non-trivial interactions between the two algorithms.

  Guidelines:
  Class Size: class should contain at least 50 lines of code.
  API Design: Imagine the class as part of a real API. Avoid using placeholders; instead, design the class as if it is going to be integrated into a real-world application.
  Class Naming: Name the class appropriately based on its functionality. Do not use the word "complex" in the class name.

  Name created files. Filenames should be provided in the comment on the first line in a following format (replace `Filename` with the actual name):
  ```
  // Filename.swift
  ```
  Provide the answer as a plain text (code only without any additional text)

  Also create an Objective-C header to expose swift methods (Filename.h) for React Native and a bridging file (Filename.m) for the swift class.
  Here's a swift class for iOS cleaner app. How would you name it? Give an answer as a single string without any additional text or characters, in a following format: `Filename.swift`

  Generate an Objective-C .m file to bridge annotated Swift classes and methods for React Native integration.

   Input:
   - Annotated Swift files containing classes and methods marked with @objc and @ReactMethod annotations.

   Output:
   - Objective-C .m file with bridging code for React Native integration.

   Steps:
   1. Parse each annotated Swift file to extract classes and methods marked with @objc and @ReactMethod annotations.
   2. For each annotated Swift class and its methods:
      a. Create corresponding Objective-C interface declarations in the .m file.
      b. Implement each method by calling the corresponding Swift method using Swift's interoperability features.
      c. Handle any necessary data conversions between Objective-C and Swift types.
   3. Ensure the generated .m file follows React Native integration conventions.
   4. Handle any errors encountered during file generation.
   5. Output the generated Objective-C .m file.
